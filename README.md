## Why?

The Cloudsultation project is a simple web application which you can use to find the best cloud service for your next project.

Many cloud services have situations in which they are better used that other, and many more have situations in which they are unusable.

For example (a very basic one) - an Azure load balancer can not be used to balance traffic by URL and therefore you would not used it in a project that requires that.

## How

It was build using Next.js, Chakra UI and React query and is deployed on Vercel.

## What's next

**Your turn!**

In order to make this app useful, I need you expertise. 

Although I know a bit about cloud services, I am not an expert in all of them.

The project is open to pull requests with additional services and situations in which to use, or not used them.

To do so:

1. Check the services.json file in the data folder
2. Add a new service to the list OR
3. Modify an existing service
4. Create a pull request
5. Discuss
6. Merge!

If you can't find a good icon for the service, don't worry, we'll handle that for you.
